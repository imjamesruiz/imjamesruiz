Hi I'm James!


I have experience in both web and mobile app development, learning front-end frameworks such as React, Angular, and React Native, and have experience using backend in FastAPI (Python), and Flask (Python) and some Node.js and Express. Currently I am improving my skills in mangaging and organizing data, using tools such as SQL/PostgreSQL, and MongoDB to build more scalable backends. 

My interests always shift and right now I am learning about cloud computing and infrastructure Follow me on my journey!
