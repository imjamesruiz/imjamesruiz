Hi I'm James!

I am currently a second-year student studying Business Information Management at the University of California Irvine. I am interested in pursuing careers in full-stack development. 

I have experience in both web and mobile app development, mainly utilizing front-end frameworks such as React and React Native, as well as Express.js, FastAPI (Python), and Flask (Python). Currently I am improving my skills in mangaing and organizing data, using tools such as SQL/PostgreSQL, and MongoDB to build more scalable backends. 

The projects I create aim to incorporate AI agents to enable smarter system behavior using LLMs and generative API. Follow me on my journey!
